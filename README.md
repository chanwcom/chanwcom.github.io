### Short Biography


Chanwoo Kim has been a corporate vice president at Samsung research leading the speech processing Lab since Feb. 2018. He has led the end-to-end speech recognition and end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) research and development at Samsung Research. He has been also working for far-field speech enhancement, key-word spotting and so on. End-to-end ASR and TTS systems have been commercialized for various Samsung products. He was a software engineer at Google speech team between Feb. 2013 and Feb. 2018. He worked for acoustic modeling for speech recognition systems and enhancing noise robustness using deep learning techniques. While working for Google, he contributed to data-augmentation and acoustic modeling of Google speech recognition systems. He was a speech scientist at Microsoft from Jan. 2011 to Jan. 2013. Dr. Kim received his Ph. D. from the Language Technologies Institute of School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University in Dec. 2010. He received his B.S and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Dr. Kimâ€™s doctoral research was focused on enhancing the robustness of automatic speech recognition systems in noisy environments. Between 2003 and 2005 Dr. Kim was a Senior Research Engineer at LG Electronics, where he worked primarily on embedded signal processing and protocol stacks for multimedia systems. Prior to his employment at LG, he worked for EdumediaTek and SK Teletech as a R&D engineer.
